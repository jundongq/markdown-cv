## Data Science Project Experience

Supervised Learning Projects:

`July 2018`
__Virtual Fish__
- Developed an _end-to-end hybrid model (ANN-CNN)_ of _fish path-choosing behavior_ (4 discrete actions) in fish passage with an accuracy of 0.604.
- Combined Deep Learning and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
- Engineers can use virtual fish to test the efficiency of fish passage design numerically. 

`September 2017`
<a href="https://github.com/jundongq/emerald-shiner-detector/">__Fish Detection__</a>

- Implemented object detection to detect emerald shiner from noisy experimental video clips, which makes measuring fish trajectory and associated instantaneous flow velocity possible. Publication in Review.
- Applied __inception__ and __Resnet-101__ model as feature extractor, to achieve fish recall up to 93%.
- Coupled _object detection_ with _motion detection_ to compute fish coordinates in each frame. 

`August 2017`
<a href="https://github.com/jundongq/Fecal-Indicator-Bacteria-Modeling-/">__Fecal Indicator Bacteria Modeling__</a>
- Employed _artificial neural network (ANN)_ to model fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in urban waterways.
- Fine-tuned ANN model achieved an accuracy score of 86% in terms of predicting whether water is safe for public access. Paper published in ASCE.

`July 2017`
<a href="https://github.com/jundongq/Findingdonors/blob/master/finding_donors.ipynb/">__Find Donors for Charity__</a>
- Created a model to predict whether a person is a potential charity donor according census data.
- Explored techniques such as __Gaussian Naïve Bayes__, __Logistic Regression__ and __adaptive Boosting__ on this problem. Optimized Adaptive Boosting model achieved accuracy score up to 0.8679.

`May 2017`
<a href="https://github.com/jundongq/Nature-Conservancy-Fisheries-Monitoring">__Fisheries Monitoring__</a>
- Implemented a benchmark LeNet to identify multiple types of fish.
- Applied __transfer learning__ (VGG16) and a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) to build a classifier with F1 score up to 0.8936.
- Computed __class activation map (CAM)__ for each image. 

`October 2016`
<a href="https://github.com/jundongq/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/student_intervention/student_intervention.ipynb">__Student Intervention System__</a>
- Created a system to predict whether students need interventions to success at schools.
- Explored techniques such as __Naïve Bayes__, __Decision Tree__ and __SVMs__ on this binary classification problem.

Unsupervised Learning Projects: 

<a href="https://github.com/jundongq/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/creating_customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb">__Customer Segments__</a>
- Revealed hidden customer segments using customer spending data
- Used __PCA__ for feature transformation and dimension reduction on customer spending history.
- Used __K-means clustering__ algorithm to identify customer segments.

Various Data Analysis Projects:

`September 2017`
<a href="https://github.com/jundongq/CameraCalibration">__Camera Calibration__</a>
- Used _OpenCV_ to calibrate camera used for large-scale particle tracking velocimetry (LS-PTV).

`September 2017`
<a href="https://github.com/jundongq/Natural-Neighbor-Interpolation-output-weights">__Natural Neighbor Interpolation__</a>
- Computed the weights of each spatially-distributed observed data point in the process of implementing natural neighbor interpolation, which were fed into environmental fluid dynamics code (EFDC) model to integrate field measurements as boundary conditions.

`March 2017`
<a href="https://github.com/jundongq/Image-Analysis-on-Porous-Filtration-Membranes">__Image Analysis on Filtration Membranes__</a>
